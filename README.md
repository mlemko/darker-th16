# darker-th16
Touhou 16 is a very bright game, from lush summer greens to the white winter snow. Unfortunately, this can present a problem for danmaku visibility (especially since this game likes to have danmaku match the colours of its background). This patch aims to fix these issues by darkening overly bright backgrounds in the game.

### Installation
For now, in order to install this patch, you must have [thtk](https://github.com/thpatch/thtk) installed on your machine. Clone this repository and copy `th16.dat` from your game folder into `./th16/th16.dat`. Afterwards, run `make`. The `th16.dat` file should be modified with the new backgrounds. Note that this permanently changes your game files. An original copy of `th16.dat` can be found in `original/` after running `make`.

Once this patch is finished, it will be integrated into the Touhou Community Reliant Automatic Patcher, and can be installed using their launcher.
