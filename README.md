# darker-th16
Touhou 16 is a very bright game, from lush summer greens to the white winter snow. Unfortunately, this can present a problem for danmaku visibility (especially since this game likes to have danmaku match the colours of its background). This patch aims to fix these issues by darkening overly bright backgrounds in the game.
